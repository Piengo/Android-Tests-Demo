# Android-tests

## Unit, instrument and UI testing with android.

* Tests can be found in the com.example.testingDemo(tests) and com.example.testingDemo(androidTests) packages.

* Note that the "Window animation scale", "Transition animation scale" and "Animator duration scale" in developer settings have to be turned off on the testing device so that UI tests work.
